I am a PhD student in Sociology at the University of Trento, Italy.

My thesis delves into the macro/meso (occupational structures and occupations) and individual consequences of technological change. I mainly adopt a comparative framework, which I leverage to understand how technology-driven labour market outcomes might be also conditional on specific institutions. To conduct the empirical analyses I use job advertisement data, administrative data as well as large-scale labour market surveys. I mainly work with STATA, but I have also familiarity with some R packages.

In general, I am interested in how technological change affects the stratification of labour market rewards as well as the nature of work and the division of labour in contemporary societies. If you are too, get in touch!

In my past I studied Economics at the University of Bologna (BA) and Sociology at the University of Trento (MA). During MA I also served as Research Assistant as well as worked in Trento as an external researcher/consultant for one of the major Union Confederations in Italy.
